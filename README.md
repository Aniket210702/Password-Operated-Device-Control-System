This embedded C project is focused on about the users' access to the system via a keypad, which, upon correct password entry, triggers a mechanism like an electric bulb. Incorrect passwords activate a red alert and buzzer. Key components include a 4x3 matrix keypad, 16x2 LCD display, and the AT89C51 microcontroller. Additional elements are a relay driver, buzzer, red LED, and electric bulb, all crucial for operation.
